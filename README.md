# GPU_Programming

A unified repository for learning and experimenting with **GPU programming** across different platforms and APIs.

## Contents

- **[CUDA](./CUDA/README.md)**  
  NVIDIA GPU programming using CUDA (kernels, threads hierarchy, memory hierarchy, optimisation, performance experiments).

- **[Metal](./Metal/README.md)**  
  Apple GPU programming using Metal (compute shaders and experiments on Apple Silicon GPUs).

Each subfolder is self-contained and includes its own build and run instructions.
